# Solara
Solara is a brand new Windows executor developed by industry expert reverse engineers. Currently Solara supports 52% UNC and is level 3 executor. Please be informed that Solara is not able to bypass byfron/hyperion currently and you should always use alt accounts to exploit Roblox.

Please also note that Solara can be detected any time and needs time to fix and update the same. The developers does not claim 100% free from banwave, therefore it is recommended to never use Solara in your main Roblox account.
